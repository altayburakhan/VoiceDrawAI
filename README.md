# VoiceDrawAI

 VoiceDrawAI, my first stating project that enables users to create art through voice commands. Merging AI with creativity, this project offers a seamless and interactive art-making experience.
Features & Technologies:

- **Voice Command Transcription:** Powered by OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate and efficient transcription.
- **AI-Driven Image Generation:** Utilizes DALL-E 3 and Google's Gemini models to create stunning visual content based on user prompts.
- **Streamlit Integration:** A user-friendly interface connects all features, allowing smooth user interactions

What I learned: This project deepened my understanding of integrating multiple AI models and handling real-time audio processing.
